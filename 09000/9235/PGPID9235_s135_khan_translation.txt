Recto

…the servant and slave
…Mūsā ibn Ṣadaqa, the Jewish merchant
In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
The benefactions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent peace and greetings be upon our master
and lord, the ‘imām of our era and time, the ‘imam al-'Āmir bi’Aḥkām Allāh, commander of the faithful, and upon 
his pure ancestors and most noble sons, enduring benedictions that last until the day of judgement. The slave kisses the ground
before the prophetic and pure noble presence, may God double its light and exalt
its beacon, and give victory to its armies, banners and helpers, and reports
That he arrived from India and Yemen with merchandise and (goods or money) in commenda
but it was detained by a pretext on which it was not lawful for it to be detained The slave had registered (documents)
in the court of the qāḍī Jalāl al-Mulk Tāj al-’Aḥkām in order to prevent any obstruction.
The slave humbly asks for a kindness to be bestowed upon him and a benefaction granted
to him by the issuing of an exalted rescript, may God increase its efficacy and nobility,
To the qāḍī Jalāl al-Mulk Tāj al-’Aḥkām (instructing him) to indicate what the slave has registered
with him, in order that this be a means of restoring his right to him, out of compassion
and commiseration for him. To our lord, the peace of God be upon his name,
belongs the exalted resolution in this, if God, the mighty and glorious, wills.  
Praise be to God alone.
The blessings and peace of God be upon our lord Muḥammad the prophet and his family.
