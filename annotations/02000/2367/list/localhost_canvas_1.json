Then it was switched to the fixed profit which he \u00a0would take from him each month </li><li>as interest on that amount, with a fixed term of 4 years. He took from him the fixed \u00a0interest of twenty </li><li>dirhams each month. Then he coerced him during this period and prevailed over him \u00a0with Islamic documents </li><li>until (Abraham) signed over the residence to him, a sale legally valid in gentile law, for \u00a0thirty-six Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d dinars. </li><li>He testified concerning it in Jewish law with a (valid Jewish) document and a qinyan, to \u00a0the effect that whenever he paid him the thirty-six dina[rs] </li><li>of Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d coinage, he or his heirs, within 12 years, the residence would revert to him or \u00a0his heirs. </li><li>Any remaining (debts in) all (promissory) notes or documents concerning what he owes \u00a0him, whether in Jewish law or in gentile law, represent the remainder </li><li>of the interest for that amount. When he asked us to confirm and verify what we we \u00a0knew of what transpired between them after </li><li>removal of the ban of the glorious judge, m(aster) Pera\u1e25ya (may his) R(ock) p(rotect \u00a0him), placed on anyone who had knowledge to </li><li>(the) testimony among them, and did not testify to this in the court, we responded to \u00a0him concerning that in order that he would have it and (that it would be) a proof. </li><li>Everything is proper and clear and enduring.</li></ol>",
