                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>&hellip; all the silver, copper, wooden vessels</li>
<li>and marble that are in it. All of this amounts to a large quantity. He broke them down</li>
<li>and with their proceeds built an enclosure designed to contain a press and shops.</li>
<li>He is enjoying income from them and in addition to all this he is receiving large sums from their rent.</li>
<li>When the exalted command and mighty documents were issued</li>
<li>(enjoining) the return of the remaining churches to their owners, constraining them (the dispossessors)</li>
<li>by law and disallowing them (to have any claims on) them (the churches) by the hand of authority (he did not heed the decree) and it has remained in his possession</li>
<li>until now, as the slave has explained. HE DID IT NOW OMG.</li>
<li>The slave of our master, the benedictions of God be upon him, would like TO DO THIS AS</li>
<li>an exalted rescript to be issued to the Bureau of Reclaimed Fiefs,</li>
<li>(instructing) the aforementioned sum to be paid to the slave within four years,</li>
<li>the first (installment) being (paid in) the kharājī year 421,</li>
<li>amounting to 24 dinars, at a rate of six dinars every [year],</li>
<li>or its return to the Christians of the district. To our master,</li>
<li>the benedictions of God be upon him, belongs the exalted resolution regarding what the slave has requested.</li>
<li>May God fulfil his promise for our master, may he cause his reign to be eternal and his army to be victorious. May he praise</li>
<li>Muhammad the prophet, his ancestor, and save him.</li>
